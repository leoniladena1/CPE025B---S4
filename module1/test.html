  <p>As Albert Einstein once said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world. The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote speaks to the idea that creativity and original thinking are more important than simply accumulating knowledge. It suggests that being able to see beyond what is 
    already known and to imagine new possibilities is a key 
    characteristic of intelligence.</p>
