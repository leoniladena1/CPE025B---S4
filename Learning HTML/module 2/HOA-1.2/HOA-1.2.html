        <h2> Chicken Adobo: The Heart and Soul of Filipino Cuisine </h2>
        <p> Chicken Adobo is one of the most iconic dishes of the Philippines, celebrated for its rich, savory, 
            and slightly tangy flavor. Slowly simmered in soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns, 
            this beloved dish reflects the Filipino tradition of simple ingredients transformed into something deeply
            comforting and unforgettable. More than just a meal, Chicken Adobo represents family, home, and the 
            warmth of shared stories around the dining table.</p>
        <blockquote> <p> <q>Adobo is not just a dish; it is a way of life for Filipinos.</q></p>

        <h3> Instructions: </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> <em> Combine chicken, soy sauce, and garlic in a large bowl. Mix well. 
                    Marinate the chicken for at least 1 hour. <strong> Note: the 
                    longer the time, the better. </strong> </em></li>
                <li> <em> Heat a cooking pot. Pour cooking oil. </em></li>
                <li> <em> When the oil is hot enough, pan-fry the marinated chicken for 2 minutes per side. </em></li>
                <li> <em> Pour-in the remaining marinade, including garlic. Add water. Bring to a boil </em></li>
                <li> <em> Add dried bay leaves and whole peppercorn. Simmer for 30 minutes or until the chicken gets tender </em></li>
                <li> <em> Add vinegar. Stir and cook for 10 minutes. </em></li>
                <li> <em> Put-in the sugar, and salt. Stir and turn the heat off.Serve hot. <strong> Share and Enjoy! </strong> </em></li>
            </ol>
        
        <h3> Tips and Tricks: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Use any chicken part when cooking Filipino chicken adobo. The common parts that I use are thigh, drumstick, and breast. </li>
                <li>The most important part of cooking chicken adobo is the marinade. The longer you let your chicken marinate in the rich combination of adobo flavors, the tastier it’ll be! I tend to make multiple batches of chicken adobo, so I can cook adobo whenever I feel like it. The longer it stays in the freezer, the more your chicken is able to absorb adobo’s amazing taste.</li>
                <li> Dark Soy Sauce is common when for adobo. However, you may use any kind of soy sauce that you prefer. Using light soy sauce is not bad. Coconut aminos will also work.</li>
                <li> White vinegar is commonly used. Cane vinegar and apple cider vinegar works too.</li>
                <li> Garlic helps make adobo delicious. Use as many garlic as you prefer. </li>
                <li> Onions can also be used for chicken adobo. If this is the case, it will need to be sautéed after pan frying the chicken.</li>
                <li> If you want your chicken to be a lot tenderer before cooking, another option is to cook the chicken in a slow cooker or crockpot overnight. This will enhance the flavors and make the chicken much juicier. </li>
            </ul>
